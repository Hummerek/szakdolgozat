User adaptation can also be important for making the user interface more accessible. Different approaches can be used for achieving these goals like providing users with means for customizing the user interface to their personal needs i.e. individualization designing content and navigation differently for varying user groups or roles i.e. such as employees of different levels citizens etc monitoring the user’s behaviour and adapting to the user’s goals that are inferred from the behaviour observed recommending information that is potentially more relevant or interesting to the specific user based on the behaviour of all users or a user group.',US
